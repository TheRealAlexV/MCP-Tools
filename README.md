# MCP-Tools

This repository contains a collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers designed for educational purposes. These servers demonstrate various capabilities and use cases for the MCP framework.

## Overview

Each MCP server in this repository is built for specific use cases but is designed to be easily modifiable for your own needs. The servers showcase different aspects of what's possible with MCP, from simple tools to more complex integrations with external APIs and services.

## Repository Structure

- `dvac_donations/` - A server for extracting donation data from PDF files using AI vision capabilities

## Educational Use

These servers are provided as learning resources to help you understand:
- How to structure MCP servers
- How to integrate with external APIs (like OpenRouter/Gemini)
- How to process different types of data (PDFs, images, etc.)
- Best practices for error handling and logging in MCP servers

## Getting Started

Each server directory contains its own README with specific instructions for:
- Setting up dependencies
- Configuring environment variables
- Running the server
- Using the provided tools

## Customization

All servers are designed to be easily modified:
- Clear code structure with comments
- Modular design for easy extension
- Well-defined tool interfaces
- Example configurations

## Prerequisites

Most servers will require:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (specified in each server's documentation)
- API keys for external services (when applicable)
